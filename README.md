Time spent: **X** hours spent in total

## Description

Very often than not, I and my friends find ourselves waiting for the metro or metro buses, but I usually find myself waiting for a long while at the metro station to catch the train in off-peak hours. Furthermore, the UI of the available metro apps do little to help our information crunch. So, we would like to help others like ourselves with a predictive map to estimate the time and if possible, prevent rush or panic among metro users. We will get the location from the user's phone and access all metro information near the user

Do not miss the metro from now on. Predictive live map to show where the metro train and metro buses are. Find all the metro information, with a great UI.

The user base is anyone who uses the metro and metro buses, but for now DC metro users.

## User Stories

**Important**
- [ ] Display the nearest stations
- [ ] Display the time of the metro and buses
- [ ] Use WMATA API
- [ ] Use OAuth, either Facebook or Twitter
- [ ] Display user's profile page
- [ ] Use Search bar to Search Stations
- [ ] Detail View Page of the trains at the stations
- [ ] Display preduct map of the selected train

The following **optional** features are implemented:

- [ ] Facebook Oauth login

The following **additional** features are implemented:

- [ ] List anything else that you can get done to improve the app functionality!

Please list two areas of the assignment you'd like to **discuss further with your peers** during the next class (examples include better ways to implement something, how to extend your app in certain ways, etc):

1. 
2.
